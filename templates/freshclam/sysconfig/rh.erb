## A predefined value for the delay in seconds. By default, the value is
## calculated by the 'hostid' program. This predefined value guarantees

## 'disabled-warn'  ...  disables the automatic freshclam update and
##                         gives out a warning
## 'disabled'       ...  disables the automatic freshclam silently
